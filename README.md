#### Covid 19 or the so-called Coronavirus Disease of 2019 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In December, 2019, the first case of the novel Coronavirus was identified in Wuhan, China. Since then, the virus has had a deadly outbreak in the entire world and is currently an ongoing pandemic.

</ul>
These symptoms may be seen in the infected person in one to fourteen days after getting exposed to the virus

#### A number of effectual vaccines have been introduced which are gradually slowing down the spread of the virus. In this research, we aim to predict the number of people/ Indians who would get fully vaccinated against the coronavirus by a particular time period of the year. the main question arises that how many people would get fully vaccinated by a specific time of the year. For its prediction, data has been gathered from a reputed source – “Our World in Data”. The above-mentioned datasets have been used to study the vaccination drives which are currently going on in India. The Covid-19 vaccination datasets have been used with different regression algorithms from the Scikit-learn library, to observe how they perform
